How to run Java CDF Tools
-------------------------
1. Set the CLASSPATH environment variable.

   CLASSPATH should point to the following information:

   - the locations (full path names) of the CDFToolsDriver.jar file and
     cdfjava.jar.  They're located in the cdf33_*-dist/cdfjava/classes and
     cdftools directory, respectivelyi, where cdf33_*-dist is either 
     cdf33_0-dist, or cdf33_1-dist, etc, whichever is the most recent release. 

   Example:
      setenv CLASSPATH .:/home/cdf/cdf33_*-dist/cdfjava/classes/cdfjava.jar: \
                       /home/cdf/cdf33_*-dist/cdfjava/cdftools/CDFToolsDriver.jar
         
        
2. Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

   LD_LIBRARY_PATH (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for Mac OS X) should point to the 
   following files:
   
   - the location (full path name) of the libcdfNativeLibrary.[so|sl|jnilib]

   - the location (full path name) of the CDF library (libcdf.[so|sl|jnilib]

   Example: 
      setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH .:/home/cdf/cdf33_*-dist/cdfjava/lib: \
                             /home/cdf/cdf33_*-dist/lib 

      Or, for Mac OS X,

      setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH .:/Users/cdf/cdf33_*-dist/cdfjava/lib: \
                               /Users/cdf/cdf33_*-dist/lib 
         

3. Invoke a desired CDF tool as follows:

   At the operating system prompt, type
   "java CDFToolsDriver".
   This will bring up the main menu from which a desired tool can be invoked by
   selecting the desired CDF tool with a single click. Alternatively, you can
   simply enter the specific tool program, instead of going through the tool
   driver. Enter, at the prompt:
   "java program_name".
   where program_name is one of the followings:
   SkeletonTable, SkeletonCDF, CDFCompare, CDFConvert, CDFInquire, CDFStats,
   CDFDir, CDFEdit and CDFExport. All program names are case-sensitive.

   Make sure you run the one of the definition files from bin/definitions.{C|B|K} 
   before you execute the command so that the CDF_BASE environment variable is 
   defined.

3. Please note: For those programs that allow the option of directing the output 
   to the screen, instead of a file, make sure that the output is not too big. 
   The Java machine could be hung or run out of memory for a big output.   

It is advised that the Sun's Java V1.4 be used to run these tools.
